# Ml Clustering

### Cluster Algorithms

- Centroid Based
    - K - means
    - mini-batch k-menas
    - k-medods
- Density Based
    - DBSCAN (density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
    - OPTICS(ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure)
    - HDBSCAN(Hierarchical DBSCAN)

- Heirarchical 
    - Agglomerative
    - Divisive
- Distribution Based
    - Gaussian Mixture Models

- Other
    - Mean Shift
    - Affinity Propagation
    - BIRCH (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Heirarchies)
    - Spectral Clustering
